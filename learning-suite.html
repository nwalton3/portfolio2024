            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>We needed to replace <span class="sc">BYU</span>&rsquo;s learning management system <span class="sc">(LMS)</span> with a new product capable of integrating directly with university systems, and able to handle the needs of professors and students across campus. It had to include a calendar system, discussion boards, assignments, gradebooks, exams, course documents, messaging, and an easy syllabus&nbsp;builder.</p>

            <h2>Users</h2>
            <p>This product serves all users of Brigham Young University courses. Course instructors use the teacher interface to create and manage course content and interactions. Students use the student interface to view course content and to interact with instructors and&nbsp;peers.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="top">
            <h2>Constraints</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges we faced was striking the balance between the needs of professors and students. Course organization styles varied wildly between professors, and many of them were reluctant to even move to a new system, let alone reorganize their entire course to fit a particular paradigm. On the other hand, students only ask for consistency between their courses. They want to know exactly where to go for all of the essential course materials and information, and it frustrates them when professors vary too&nbsp;much.</p>
            <p>We also operated under some pretty heavy time constraints. The university had an aggresive deadline for dropping the old system, which gave us less than a year to have the new system built, tested, and ready for professors. We had to make tough decisions about what was really essential for the campus&nbsp;release.</p>

            <p>Instructional designers were responsible for gathering requirements, helping to align our interface with current research on education practices where needed, creating wireframes, and giving feedback on&nbsp;designs.</p>

            <p>Based on the needs we had and the constraints we were working under, I wrote this set of guidelines with some input from the team.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <section class="sub">
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Initial research and requirements-gathering was conducted by the instructional designers on the team. They often met with professors and could gather a good picture of what they needed. We also leveraged our usage statistics to gain insights on how the product was being used and how it might improve. As the <span class="sc">UI</span> became more established later on in the project, I participated in focus groups, observation sessions, and user&nbsp;interviews.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h3>Plan and wireframe</h3>
                <p>Design for a feature usually started with a whiteboard session (or several) which included me and an instructional designer. Once we came to agreement on the general layout, they usually created the wireframe from that discussion. This was a very fluid part of the process, and each of us contibuted to the <span class="sc">UX</span> design of a given interaction. There were sometimes several rounds of discussion and&nbsp;wireframing.</p>

            <section class="sub">
                <h3>Design UI</h3>
                <p>I was solely responsible for designing the <span class="sc">UI</span>. I created hundreds of screen mockups with notes, instructions, and cross-references to clearly document and articulate the design to&nbsp;developers.</p>
                <p>For any complex interaction I also created an <span class="sc">HTML</span> mockup for review and testing. This was especially true for screens that required animation or interactive visual feedback to the user. I built those interactions myself and then passed them to&nbsp;developers.</p>

                <h3>Develop</h3>
                <p>Developers used the <span class="sc">UI</span> design system to implement new designs. I consulted with them as needed throughout the build process, and reviewed the final&nbsp;result.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h3>Test and gather feedback</h3>
                <p>Once a design was built in our testing environment, our regression testing team wrote and tested their scripts for how the interface was intended to work. Once it was working as designed, we reviewed it and showed it to users before final release. Big features were released to selected professors for real-world testing and feedback before final&nbsp;release.</p>
                <p>I also made it a practice to &ldquo;eat our own dog food,&rdquo; as one of the developers used to say. I actively taught evening classes in the <span class="sc">BYU</span> design department and (of course) used Learning Suite wherever it made sense. I found that directly using the product uncovered many opportunities for me to suggest or make&nbsp;improvements.</p>

                <h3>Smart syllabus builder</h3>
                <p>Adapting a course schedule to a new semester is a time-consuming task. It can also be error-prone because you need to account for university holidays and other scheduling anomalies. We built a syllabus tool that could automatically transfer assignments to a new semester and make a really good guess at where they should be placed. It even converts from semester to term and back. Once instructors enter their assignments in Learning Suite, it became easier to maintain from semester to&nbsp;semester.</p>

            <h2>Success measures</h2>
            <p>Measuring our work on this project presented a few challenges. First, any fine-tuned quantitative measurements were left out of the first release in favor of just finishing the baseline features for instructors and students. We did track adoption rates, which increased each semester. The number of university courses using Learning Suite eclipsed the previous <span class="sc">LMS</span> after a few semesters, which we interpreted as a very positive trend. It currently enjoys usage rates that are significantly higher than the previous&nbsp;system.</p>
            <p>We had several sources of qualitative feedback. There was a prominent Help feature within the interface. We made members of our team available for direct feedback electronically or in person. We also engaged in interviews, focus groups, and surveys. All of this helped us populate our bug tracking system and also define our roadmap and releases. As you might expect, support tickets have decreased over time and feedback has become more and more&nbsp;positive.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>The further I get from this project the more amazed I am that we pulled it off. Part of that success came from extremely dedicated and hard-working lead developers. One of the things I appreciate most about them was that they cared about the user experience and often offered good feedback on my work. The other thing I think that made it work was a design system that was established right out of the gate, including visuals <em>and</em> front-end code for many standard components. That allowed both design and development to communicate effectively and work&nbsp;quickly.</p>

            <p>I make interfaces that work for people. I spend most of my time in design and user testing, but I&rsquo;ve also been known to code when it helps me improve people&rsquo;s experience (I love functional prototypes).</p>
