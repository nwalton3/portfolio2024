        <p>This was my Master&rsquo;s thesis project. I completed an MFA in graphic design at Indiana University in 2006. I spent a semester in the Lilly Special Collections Library at Indiana University studying print history and fine presses.</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>The Lilly Library has some of the most famous, rare, and beautiful books in the world. I wanted to help people better appreciate some of the best books, and the collaborative efforts that produced them.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="top">
            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>Invitations were sent to the library&rsquo;s supporters and normal mailing list for exhibitions. Faculty and students from the School of Fine Arts were also invited. It was a public exhibition, but patrons tended to be quite educated, and disposed to be book lovers.</p>

            <h2>Constraints</h2>
            <p>I had one room with two walls containing glass cases. Books can be difficult to display effectively, since only a small fraction (one open spread) can ever be visible at one time.</p>

            <p>I was solely responsible for all of the research, planning, design, and execution of the exhibition.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="top">
            <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
            <p>I wanted to go beyond the standard library exhibition, which consists of an open book with a small identifying caption and perhaps a description. I planned to create experiences with the books that went beyond just viewing them behind glass.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>I spent a semester researching and photographing hundreds of books in the collection. I learned about their design, typography, printing, and binding. I was especially interested in the individuals who contributed to the books, which included many famous artists and authors such as Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Fernand LÃ©ger, Maya Angelou, Wynton Marsalis, William Morris, Eric Gill, and Bruce Rogers.</p>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>This exhibition required extensive planning. I took measurements of every space and designed a digital scale model for the whole show.</p>

                <h3>Hands-on elements and audio narration</h3>
                <p>To get the viewer closer to the books, I had several interactive elements, including audio stations, type specimens, and books to flip through.</p>

            <p>I make interfaces that work for people. I spend most of my time in design and user testing, but I&rsquo;ve also been known to code when it helps me improve people&rsquo;s experience (I love functional prototypes).</p>
